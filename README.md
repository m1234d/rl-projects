These are my implementations of various reinforcement learning techniques. I am starting from Q-learning, and will implement Deep Q Networks, Double and dueling q networks, actor-critic models, and eventually PPO. I will be training these models in OpenAI's gym and retro environments.

Current Status:
Q-Learning - DONE

Deep Q Networks - DONE

Improved Deep Q Networks - Double Dueling Deep Q-Networks. Missing priority experience replay
